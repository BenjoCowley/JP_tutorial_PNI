# Journal Paper Tutorial class for PNI
Purpose: To expose students to research articles in neuroscience.\
Each week you will have read one scientific paper before class. During class, we will discuss the claims and results of the paper while also learning how to read scientific papers.

## Class details

Meets: Mondays, 7:30pm - 9pm  (zoom link will be sent before each class) (Oct. 19 - Nov. 16, 2020) \
Instructor: Dr. Benjamin Cowley \
Grade (second half of semester): Depends on class participation (20%) and a final paper (30%)

## Final paper
A large portion (30%) of your grade is the final paper for this half-semester. You will choose one of the four papers we have discussed and write about it. The paper will be no more than 7 pages long.  Please see your syllabus for further information.\
The paper will be due **Jan. 15 at 5pm**, e-mailed to the course instructor.
